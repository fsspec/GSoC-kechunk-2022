# GSoC-kechunk-2022

This repo has been used to monitor the work I have done during my time as a Google Summer of Code Contributer. 

The work I have done over the past few months has ranged from helping to trouble shoot errors raised by the community, exploring ways to optimise and speed up the existing code base, creating convenience functions to execute common workflows and creating a new tutorial covering the full range of functionality offered by Kerchunk. I have also written an article highlighting the functionality of Kerchunk as well as providing two tutorials that I created during my time as a GSOC contributor. This article will soon be published on the Pangeo Medium Site. 

A more detailed description of the work I have done is available in the [GSOC_monitor.md](https://github.com/fsspec/GSoC-kechunk-2022/blob/main/GSOC_monitor.md) document.
